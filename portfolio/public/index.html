    <a href="http://dc-events.surge.sh/">Deployed Front End</a>
    <a href="https://github.com/F3RULLO8/dc-events-front">Github Repository</a>
    <a href="https://dc-events-back.herokuapp.com/events ">Deployed Back End</a>
    <a href="https://github.com/F3RULLO8/dc-events-back">Github Repository</a>
    <p>The purpose of DC Events application is to provide users with an easy to use platform th share current events in the
        DC Metro Area. I was apart of a three man team to complete this project within a week on a two server platform. Features
        included in this project are full CRUD capabilities to our events model. Create and read features with our venue
        model. The user can explore the events which show the display basic information about that event and the venue it
        is being hosted at. Technologies used for this project are html, css, javascript, mongo, express, react, node.js,
        and cors. </p>
    <h4>Spiphy</h4>
    <h5>July 2018-August 2018 </h5>
    <a href="https://spiphy.herokuapp.com/">Deployed Application</a>
    <a href="https://github.com/F3RULLO8/project-2-fullstackapp">Github Repository</a>
    <p>For this project I used HTML, CSS, Javascript, Express with Mongoose, MongoDB, Node JS, and passport for authentication
        to create a social media application to share and store gifs. The user can sign up or sign in. Once they are in the
        application they can create a gif with an image URL. It will then populate the home page and the specific users page.
        They then can leave comments on gifs or delete them. This shows full CRUD capabilities, authentication used with
        passport to save passwords for the user, and followed a rMVC structure. </p>
    <h4>Hangman</h4>
    <h5>July 2018-July 2018 </h5>
    <a href="https://f3rullo8.github.io/project-1-hangman/">Deployed Application</a>
    <a href="https://github.com/F3RULLO8/project-1-hangman">Github Repository</a>
    <p>For this project I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript. to create a fun game application to play clasic hangman. The user
        can enter any word or phrase into the input field and the empty spaces will appear. The user has 6 guesses to try
        and figure out the word or they lose! This was my first project in my cohort and I coudln't be prouder with how it
        turned out. The peice of code im proud of is how I was able to create divs that didnt show there assigned letter
        until it was guessed.</p>
